# Future tasks for this project
- translate the data gathering/pre-processing tasks developed by Kufre in R into the Python notebook
- a big stumbling block was python for creating a hexagonal tesselation. This might be the answer: https://github.com/urschrei/hexcover
  - remember to create an 'area' field, or perhaps better yet, don't store that and consider it a constant in future versions of the notebook
- add code for creating all the maps and graphs in the published paper
- thoroughly benchmark differences in processing times
- look for opportunities to maintain data as attributes/tables without geometries only, including a data structure representing relationships between hospitals, tracts, zip code tabulation areas, and hexagons
